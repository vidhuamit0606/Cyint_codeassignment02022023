Rules for Roman Numerals
1    V     X      L     C    D     M
1    5     10     50   100  500   1000

Repition : Repeted symbol => add value,

a) MAx repeat = 3
b) No repeat for V, J and D

(MMM)/(MMXiV)
Number one (I) can be subtracted from 5(V) and 10(X)

X can be subtracted from L,C and M only (MlXVI)

lets do some conversion

2019
 2000
MM

next digit is 0(doesnt mean anything) ignore once

next digit 1(means 10 actually ) -->
MM
X
next digit is 9 can be write as IX(10 - 1)
MMXiX

1776
700 --> DCC(500  + 100 + 100)
until MDCC

next 70 --> LXX(50 +10 + 10)
until now MDCCLXX
next is  6 --> Vi(5 + 1)
the rightmost digit
so now number is MDCCLXXVi

largest number that can be represents as per rules 3999 as MMMCmXCIX

------------------------------------------------------
to convert from Ronam Numerals
we start from rightmost

as MMXiV
IV ----> 5 1--ask ques can we combine(Yes ) 5-1 =4 --> 
next XIV --can we combine now as 10 ca not be used in the ones digit --> so we stop ---> so first digirtis formed as 4

next X--> can we combine X(10) with M --> no -> so number is until now 14

in place of hundred --> I write as 0 as there is no hundred digit and continue to look for combine as MM which is 2000 so in place of add as 2014

I take another example to test the rules
MLXVI --> VI (6 + 1=6)    so 6 as one's digit 

X can not combine with 6 as X is in 10's place so leave as it is 

next L(50) can combine with X (10) 50 + 10 =60 --> 66
again M can not be combined with 66 as it is in 1000 so there is nothing in hundrd's place so we leavas 0--> M(1000) +  066--> 1066
